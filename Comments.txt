  - There are no instruction on how to run the code.
  - README.md is not very clear.

The git has not been used: only one commit...

Implementation:
  - Challenge text required a namespace algebra.

Checklist:
  - sparse_matrix constructor:   OKAY
  - upper_bound and lower_bound: OKAY
  - comparison operator:         OKAY
  - compress:                    OKAY
  - uncompress:                  OKAY
  - data is properly cleared:    OKAY
  - resize method:               OKAY
  - operator*:                   OKAY  (but the text required it to be friend, right?)
  - reading from file:           OKAY
  - call to non-const / const assignment operator: FAILED

@@@
const SparseMatrix<double, StorageOrder::Row_wise> M_row_const(M_row);
std::cout << M_row_const[{0,3}] << std::endl;
Rises an error. The operator[] is const, but you accessing a chunk of memory that has not being allocated.

NO EXTRA.
