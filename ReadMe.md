CHALLENGE 2: A sparse matrix
--------------------------------------
This GitBub repository contains the second challenge from PACS course made by Miguel Alca√±iz Moya.
 
The repository contains the code in the main.cpp file, the sparse matrix class defined in the sparse_matrix.hpp, the data from the example matrix in the lnsp_131.mtx file and the Makefile.

Summary of the main
--------------------------------------
Although the main is already commented, if you execute the code it will print several examples of matrix using the class created for sparse matrix.

At first it sets a 4x4 matrix stored row-wise and it prints it in its uncompressed and compressed state.
Then it set the same matrix but stored column-wise and print it uncompressed and compressed.
After it gives an example of the product of matrices times vector.

Then it reads from the file lnsp_131 the matrix given as example for the challenge.

Finally it prints the time that it takes to do the product between a big sparse matrix times a vector in the different tipes of matrix forms (compressed/uncompressed and row-wise/column-wise).
